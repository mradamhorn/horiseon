# Homework 1 README for Adam Horn

# My discription and comments on homework 1

Issues noticed include: 
Header div for "Search Engine Optimization" navigation link did not link to the SEO block
Header div font was incorrect - when changed, noticed another issue that brought the header div line below the header block
Code can be cleaned up with comments indicating use of secions, divs, blocks, etc. 
Margin between benefit block and content blocks larger than margins between content blocks
When reducing width of browser, content block text overflows the block and benefit block drops below the content blocks
Many of the CSS declarations could be consolidated


Changes made in index.html file:
Linked header div for "Search Engine Optimization" to appropriate block
Inserted comments for each element to increase readability



Changes made in style.css file:
Changed header div font family to 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif
Consolidated declarations with the benefits block
Consolidated declarations with the contents block
