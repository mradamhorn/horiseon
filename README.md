# Horiseon Marketing Agency Webpage

## Description

This Horiseon Marketing Agency webpage is a refractor exercise to improve skill with HTML and CSS. This exercise allowed me to learn to identify issues with broken links; clean up code in both HTML and CSS; consolidate CSS styling for multiple elements; insert comments for any coders access the file after me and quickly identify what they need to work on; fix overflow, accessibility, and other issues.
